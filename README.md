# Low-cost-Programmable-Pulse-Generator

Low-cost (<$10) system capable of generating waveforms upto 40KHz and 10V p-p on two analog outputs along with generation of a DC signal of desired voltage. 
A virtual COM power using a 115200 baud, 8N1 protocol with no hardware handshaking is used for supporting the waveform generation commands.
